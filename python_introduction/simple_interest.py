# Define the principal amount, annual interest rate (as a decimal), and time in years
principal = 1000  # P
rate = 0.05       # R (5%)
time = 3          # T (in years)

# Calculate the simple interest
# Formula: I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the calculated simple interest
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
